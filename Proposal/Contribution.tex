\section{Contributions}
%Following are the main contributions of our project.

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 
\textit{Comparison of LST and Pfair}: Performance of LST have never been
extensively studied and there exists no performance comparison between Pfair and
LST to the best of our knowledge. This is primarily because, the active
monitoring requirement of LST makes any software implementation of LST highly
inefficient. Our project would give us an opportunity to do a comparative study between
Pfair and LST.

%\item 
\textit{Energy and Area benefits without loosing optimality}: Pfair scheduling algorithm
is computationally very expensive in comparison to LST. However, since both are
optimal algorithms for scheduling tasks on multicore systems, using hardware LST
in  place of hardware Pfair scheduler, we can achieve same optimal schedule with less
hardware complexity and energy consumption.
%\end{enumerate}
